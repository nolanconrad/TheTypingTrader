            <p> Owning both MGM(MGM) and Wynn Resorts(WYNN), I'm feeling a bit uneasy about what there is to come. Yes I have made decent gains since my purchasing them both back at the relative bottom in March, but there is still a long ways to go from here. With cases in major cities, such as Las Vegas, surging once again, I think there is going to be new measures put in place that could potentially further squash sin city.  </p>
