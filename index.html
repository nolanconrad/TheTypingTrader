                    <p> Hopefully you were aware that US markets were closed today. I think it is unnececary to do so since 4th of July falls on a weekend this year. None the less, some research told me that the stock markets tend to follow the government holiday scheprecdule. In this case, any official holiday that falls on a weekend, is "taken off", via the preceding Friday to that weekend. So in that case, enjoy the holiday weekend. Please take a look at the Weekend Opinion Page, where I will be adding a market related opinion article every Sunday evening. </p>

                    <p> Watching my account go up and down lately has been no fun, but I think that is just part of a nature of things right now. With new news coming out each day, I think it's hard to see any sort of stable climb. Thankfully things seemed to be headed in the overall right direction, but I dont think it will be without more dives. At the time of this article, the S&P sits at 3,130 points, just 100 under it's highest peak since things got ugly. So while it wont be a smooth ride I think that the index is a good indicator that things are getting much better.  </p>

                    <p> Owning both MGM(MGM) and Wynn Resorts(WYNN), I'm feeling a bit uneasy about what there is to come. Yes I have made decent gains since my purchasing them both back at the relative bottom in March, but there is still a long ways to go from here. With cases in major cities, such as Las Vegas, surging once again, I think there is going to be new measures put in place that could potentially further squash sin city.  </p>
